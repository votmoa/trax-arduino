# T-RAX Arduino

This is the Arduino C++(ish) code for the RFO Roof Controller. It is complemented by the T-RAX Java code
which implements the user interface for the Roof Controller.

| DebugOff    | Turn off debugging messages
| Status      | Display sensoer status

### Function Descriptions

TBD

### Configuring Arduino IDE

The LCD requires a library that is not included with the Arduino IDE:

http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-LCD_RGB_Backlight/

Then navigate to Sketch --> Inlcude Library --> Add .ZIP Library

Once imported, select:
* Grove LCD RGB Backlight master
* Wire
